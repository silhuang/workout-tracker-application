# Pilates Workout Tracker Application

## Keep all your Pilates & workout choreo in one single app! 


The **Pilates Workout Tracker Application** will allow users to keep track of their workouts on a single app. 
When users create a new workout, they can add as many tracks as they wish to the workout. 
**Tracks** contain **different moves in a certain order (choreography)**, where each **move** is associated with a 
**name** and **number of reps**. Originally, this app was intended for Pilates instructors to record the choreography 
of every track in each of their workouts in one place, but it can also be used by anyone who would like to 
record their workouts in a single application. _This project is of interest to me because I was previously a 
POP Pilates instructor with the UBC Pilates Club_. As I learned different POP choreographies (i.e. workouts), 
I wrote down the moves of every track inside a notebook, but thought it would be more convenient to store 
the information I recorded inside an app that I can access anytime.
