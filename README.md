# Pilates Workout Tracker Application

## Keep all your Pilates & workout choreo in one single app! 


The **Pilates Workout Tracker Application** will allow users to keep track of their favourite workout on a single app. 
When users create a new workout, they can add as many tracks as they wish to the workout. 
**Tracks** contain **different moves in a certain order (choreography)**, where each **move** is associated with a 
**name** and **number of reps**. Originally, this app was intended for Pilates instructors to record the choreography 
of every track their chosen workout in one place, but it can also be used by anyone who would like to 
record their workout in a single application. _This project is of interest to me because I was previously a 
POP Pilates instructor with the UBC Pilates Club_. As I learned different POP choreographies (i.e. workouts), 
I wrote down the moves of every track inside a notebook, but thought it would be more convenient to store 
the information I recorded inside an app that I can access anytime.

User Stories:

- As a user, I can add as many tracks as I want to a workout
- As a user, I can add as many moves as I want to any given track
- As a user, I can delete any previously added
  - tracks from a workout
  - moves from a track
  
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the tracks recorded so far my workout
- As a user, I want to be able to view the order and reps of moves in any track

**Data Persistence**
- As a user, when I select "Quit application" from the main menu, I want to be given the option of 
  whether I would like to save my newly created workout to file
- As a user, when I start the application, I have the option of loading my previous workout from file
  by clicking "Load saved workout" from the main menu
